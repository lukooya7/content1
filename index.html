<h4>Introduction</h4>
<img class="img" src="images/aids.png" >
<h5>Figure 26</h5>
<p>There are over 40 million people living with HIV and AIDS worldwide and over 24 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS estimated in 2012 that 6.1 percent of Kenyans and 5.1 percent of Tanzanians aged 15 -49 are infected with HIV and 6.2 percent of Ugandans aged 15-64 are infected with HIV. Over half of<hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
all new infections are in young people 24 and under. HIV and AIDS is spreading among young people in Africa faster than in any other age group. Young women are even more vulnerable.
</p>
<ul>HIV and AIDS<br>
HIV is an abbreviation of,<br>
Human Immuno-deficiency Virus.
</ul>
<p>This virus cause AIDS. This is a virus termed as HIV because it infects and affects HUMAN BEINGS. Viruses are parasitic in nature; they cannot live on their own. Immuno-deficiency means the immune system is weak and unable to fight off infections and illnesses. Secondly, when it affects human beings, it destroys the body’s ability to fight off diseases, this makes the immune system defenseless and vulnerable to all forms of infections. When HIV weakens the immune system, it is easy for people to become sick. When a person with HIV becomes sick with many illnesses that do not respond to treatment, he or she is said to have AIDS</p>
<ul>What is AIDS?<br>
AIDS is an abbreviation of:<br>
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
</ul>
<p>ACQUIRED is something you get, IMMUNE is the resistance against infections, DEFICIENCY is the lack of and in this context lack of protection, SYNDROME is the collection of signs and symptoms. AIDS is a term used to indicate the most serious stage of a person’s infection with HIV. It means that they have a particular collection of symptoms and diseases defined medically as AIDS.</p>
<p>Difference between HIV and AIDS<br>
HIV and AIDS is therefore a condition characterized by illnesses.
</p>
<ul>● A person with HIV looks healthy and strong while a person with AIDS is sick<br>
● A person can live HIV and take long time before developing AIDS<br>
● A person with HIV cannot be recognized unless he/she is subjected to an HIV antibody test
</ul>
<h5>HIV Transmission</h5>
<ul>● Having unprotected sex with an HIV infected person. HIV concentration is high in the fluids, blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids are exchanged during sexual intercourse, HIV cross over from an HIV infected person to the other<br>● Sharing unsterilized contaminated skin piercing instruments. Such instruments include injection needles, razor blades, safety pins, circumcision knives, toothbrushes, etc. since these instruments carry blood, and transmission of HIV can occur if they are shared.<br><hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
● Being transfused with HIV infected blood. HIV CONCENTRATION IS ALSO HIGH IN HUMAN BLOOD though blood for transfusion is widely tested against HIV, there is still some risk. At times the blood donor may donate blood when she/he is in window period,
that is, when the body has not yet formed enough antibodies against HIV. This means there are antibodies to HIV, hence the person is told that s/he is HIV negative when in actual fact the person is infected<br>● Vertical Transmission. An HIV infected mother can pass HIV to her unborn baby. This occurs mainly during pregnancy, when the baby is still in the womb it does share some blood with the mother. The baby’s blood stream is linked to that of the mother through the placenta. An infected mother can also pass HIV to the baby at the time of delivery or shortly after birth.<br>● HIV exist in breast milk thus breast feeding is one of the ways of HIV transmission from an infected mother to the baby or a child.</ul>
<h5>ACTIVITY</h5>
<p>To help you understand more on HIV/AIDs watch the following video in full.</p>
<h4>TRANSMISSION OF HIV</h4>
<img class="img" src="images/aids2.png" >
<h5>Figure 27</h5>
<p>Myths Surrounding HIV Infection and Disease</p>
<p>These are sentiments or perceptions people have about HIV and AIDS which are not true</p>
<ul>1.Casual contact</ul>
<p>Having casual contact with a person with AIDS such as shaking hands, touching, kissing, using household’s utensils, sitting together and living in the same room will not transmit HIV. This is because casual contacts do not involve the exchange of body fluids which harber HIV, e.g., sexual fluids, blood etc.</p>
<ul>2.  Insect bites</ul>
<p>Insect bites that is mosquitoes, bedbugs, lice, fleas, tsetse flies, Jiggers etc. These insects that suck human blood use it for feeding. HIV cannot survive in the body of insects. Insects do not inject blood into us. Those that transmit certain infections do so by injecting certain substances in the human body, for instance, mosquitoes inject saliva infested with malaria parasites into human beings which causes them to suffer from malaria</p>
<ul>3.  Witchcraft.</ul>
<p>Witchcraft, spell, or charms cannot transmit HIV. HIV cannot pass through a vacuum. However, there is need to put some special concern on witchcraft practices, especially where sharing the use of skin piecing instruments are involved. False tooth-extraction in babies, is highly dangerous as it can cure HIV infection among infections.</p>
<h4>HIV and AIDS cannot be transmitted by the following activities:</h4>
<ul>● Touching, hugging, talking to or sharing a home with a person who is HIV infected or has AIDS.<br>
● Sharing plates, utensils, glasses or towels used by someone with HIV or AIDS.<br>
● Using swimming pools, toilet seats, door knobs, telephones or other items used by people with HIV or AIDS<br>
● Having someone with HIV or AIDS spit, sweat or cry on you.<br>
● Being bitten by mosquitoes.<br>
● Donating blood.<br>
● Being sneezed at or coughed on by a person with HIV or AIDS
</ul>
<h5>Signs and Symptoms</h5>
<p>The most common signs that, someone has AIDS are diseases such as tuberculosis or pneumonia. However, the following can also be signs that someone has AIDS:</p>
<ul>1.  Sudden, unexplained weight loss<br><hr>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
2.  Fever for more than one month<br>
3.  Diarrhea for more than one month<br>
4.  Genital or anal ulcers for more than one month<br>
5.  Oral Candidiasis<br>
6.  Persistent Cough for more than one month<br>
7.  Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
8.  Skin infections that is severe or recurring
</ul>
<p>Although the above can all be symptoms of AIDS, the only way to tell if a person is infected with HIV is by testing, because the above can be symptoms of other illnesses or diseases.</p>
<h4>Effects of HIV in the Human Body </h4>
<h5>How does HIV affect the body?</h5>
<p>HIV lives and survives in the human cells. White blood cells are responsible for our immune system. After years of living normally with HIV, a person’s immune system begins to weaken and they start developing AIDS and become vulnerable to opportunistic infections, which can attack any part of the body. HIV affects the human body attacking the bodies defence mechanism (Immune system) making the body unable to fight off infection. Opportunistic infections are infections that take attack the body when the immune system is weak. These infections could range from simple medical conditions like fungal infections and colds to more serious diseases like tuberculosis, cancer among others. Though the person is HIV positive, these conditions can be treated and often cured. It is important to note that there is no cure for HIV or AIDS.<br>When HIV enters the human body, the body produces specific antibodies to try and fight infections. However, these antibodies produced are ineffective against HIV. When the body’s ability to fight off infection reduces, the body is subjected to diseases known as OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. These diseases are referred to as opportunistic infections because they take advantages of the body’s reduced immunity. Some common opportunistic infections contracted by people with HIV include Gastro-intestinal tract infections leading to diarrhea, skin infections, chest infections, oral candidiasis (Oral thrust), tuberculosis (TB) and Herpes Zoster and many others. Many of these opportunistic infections can be treated. There is no cure for HIV and AIDS</p>
<ul>HIV Testing information<br>
HIV Positive</ul>
<img class="img" src="images/test.png" >
<h5>Figure 28</h5>
<p>When the body’s defense system (immune system) comes into contact with a disease, it produces germ fighters, called antibodies, which fight off and destroy various viruses and germs that invade the body. An antibody is found in the blood and it tells us that the person has been infected with a particular germ or virus.<br>HIV tests look for HIV antibodies. If the body is making antibodies to fight HIV, then someone is considered HIV positive. However, there is a “window period” between when a person is infected with HIV and when a blood test shows that a person is HIV-positive, because it takes the body a little while to start producing antibodies to fight the virus. It is possible for someone to test HIV-negative during this window period but be infected with HIV, this is called a false negative. During this time, people who are HIV infected are able to transmit the virus to others. The window period is generally three months but in very rare cases could be six months. People who have a negative test result and have had unprotected sex during the past three months are advised to go for another test in three months. While waiting through the window period, they must avoid being exposed to HIV.</p>
<h4>When are People with HIV Infectious to Others?</h4>
<p>People with HIV can infect others as soon as they are infected with the virus. People with HIV may not know they are infected and may look, act and feel healthy for a long time, possibly longer than 10 years. It impossible to tell from looking at someone if he or she is infected.</p>
<h5>From HIV to AIDS</h5><hr>
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<img class="img" src="images/hivprogression.png" >
<h5>Figure29</h5>
<p>As with other infections, when HIV enters the body, the immune system produces a response to try to fight off the infection, by producing antibodies. However, these are insufficient to battle against the growth and multiplication of the virus, which slowly destroys key cells in the immune system. HIV slowly weakens the immune system and eventually the body cannot fight off even mild infections. At this point, people become very sick from a range of different illnesses, including the common cold, fungal infections, cancer, or tuberculosis.<br>Most people who have HIV do not become sick right away. In some cases, it can take as many as 10 years or more for a person to develop AIDS. People can stay healthy longer by eating well and getting prompt treatment of illnesses and infections.</p>
<h4>Some of the Effects of HIV and AIDS to people infected and affected</h4>
<ul>People who are HIV-positive may be faced with a lot of stigma and are discriminated against or shunned in their communities because of misunderstandings or misconceptions about HIV and AIDS in the community.<br>Adolescents may be particularly susceptible to negative attitudes, depression and may be forced out of their school or home.<br>They may also be isolated by friends and emotional challenges like withdrawal from activities and people can be exhibited<br><hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
They are typically less aware of their legal rights, more vulnerable to financial hardships, and less able to find and purchase care among others.</ul>
<h4>Supporting people infected and affected with HIV and AIDS</h4>
<h5>Important aspects of positive living</h5>
<p>Positive living is a concept which stipulates that a person should have an optimistic attitude towards self and others. it involves having a positive outlook to living and life. It also means living responsibly with HIV. People with HIV infection can prolong their lives by making positive choices to care for their own mental and physical health.
Therefore, it is important to encourage people to do the following as important aspects of positive living;<br>Proper nourishment that is encouraging them to have a balanced diet is an essential part of positive living. A person with HIV infection needs to feed with essential nutrients required by the body and these includes proteins both plants and animal proteins which help to repair cells of the body. Carbohydrates i.e. body building foods like rice, maize, cassava, potatoes etc. and vitamins to help the body to fight infections such examples of vitamin food are fruits and vegetables. Encouraging people to have enough rest and sleep to help reduce on fatigue and strained on already on weak body, Regular light physical exercises, encouraging them to seek medical care and counselling, Keeping the body clean generally maintaining hygiene of the environment. Spiritual care through fellowship etc. Encouraging social economic involvement to keep them busy etc.<br></p>
<p>Risky and Non-Risky Behaviors <br>Definitely a Risk</p>
<ul>1.  Engaging in early sexual intercourse with infected person.<br>
2.  Sharing needles for drug use.<br>
3.  Sharing needles for circumcision or ear piercing.
</ul><hr>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h5>Probably a Risk</h5>
<ul>1.  Being born to a mother who is HIV positive.<br>
2.  Getting a blood transfusion.
</ul>
<h5>Probably Not a Risk</h5>
<ul>1.  Sharing a toothbrush.<br>
2.  Deep or (open mouth) kissing.
</ul>

<ul>1.  Abstaining from sexual intercourse.<br>
2.  Kissing.<br>
3.  Being close to a person with HIV who is coughing.<br>
4.  Donating blood.<br>
5.  Using a public telephone.<br>

9.  Going to school with a person who has AIDS.<br>
10. Being bitten by a mosquito.<br>
11. Having a mutually monogamous and faithful relationship with a person who has tested negative for HIV.
</ul>
<h5>HIV PREVENTION</h5>
<ul>● Abstinence-The only certain way to protect you against HIV transmission is to abstain from sexual intercourse.<br>
● Avoid sharing skin piecing instruments like razor blade, needles, knives etc<br>
● Seek for the right information from good people for example mentors<br>
● Avoid risky places or associating with people whom you do not trust

● Physical causes – for example, a head injury or a neurological condition such as epilepsy can have an impact on your behavior and mood. (It's important to rule out potential physical causes before seeking further treatment for a mental health problem).

<h1 id="A4">Session 4: MENSTRUATION</h1>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<h5>Activity</h5>
<p>Now that you have an idea of what menstruation is, pair with your friend or get in a group and prepare a presentation to demonstrate your understanding of menstruation and menstruation cycle.</p>
<h4>Our key question are:</h4>
<ul>● What is menstruation?<br>
● Who does menstruates?<br>
● When does menstruation start?
</ul>
<h3>MENSTRUATION TOOLS</h3>
<img class="img" src="images/tools.png">
<h5>Figure 34</h5>
<p>The menstrual cycle is the period of time beginning on the first day of a woman’s period until the day before she begins her next period. Since this happens regularly, it is called a “cycle.” The length of time between one period and the next varies for each woman. For some, the cycle is 21 days (or fewer). For others, it is as long as 35 days or more. Irregular periods are common in girls who are just beginning to menstruate.<hr>
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
It may take the body a while to adjust to all the changes taking place. For example, a girl may have the same length cycle for two months, then miss a month, or have two periods with fewer days in between them.<br>Her menstrual cycle will probably become more regular, although she may continue to have irregular periods into adulthood. Sometimes she might have some spotting of blood for a day or two in the middle of her cycle. This is usually nothing to worry about. Stress, infections or poor nutrition can disrupt a regular menstrual cycle.
</p>
<h4>OVULATION</h4>
<p>Ovulation is the periodic release of a mature egg from the ovary. The time from ovulation to the next period is a very consistent length of 12 to 16 days and is controlled by hormones. The two weeks or so before ovulation and the two weeks after make a menstrual cycle about four weeks or a month long.</p>
<h4>MENOPAUSE</h4>
<p>Menopause is when a woman’s menstruation ends. It ends because the hormones that cause eggs to mature in her ovaries stop. When this happens, women can no longer become pregnant.
Menopause usually happens after age 45. But, menopause can take place earlier or later than this.
Some women may stop menstruating by the time they are 35, and some not until their late fifties.</p>
<h4>Female Reproductive System Story:<br>
The Menstrual Cycle</h4>
<p>An egg starts to develop in the ovary. While the egg is developing, the lining of the uterus is getting thick and soft. The egg is released by the ovary. The egg travels to the uterus. If the egg doesn’t meet a sperm, it dissolves. About two weeks later, since the lining of the uterus is not needed for a pregnancy, it comes out through the vagina.</p>
<h3>TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h3>
<p>Ten thousand girls drop out of school every year because of pregnancy! Several factors contribute to this problem: parents do not generally talk to their sons and daughters about sex, children lack information about their changing bodies, and adolescents may not understand how <hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
to control the sexual urges that come up naturally at puberty. The issue of teenage pregnancy can be addressed by teaching young people skills that will help them make appropriate decisions, be assertive and resist early sexual activity.<br>Several studies have shown that the outcomes for adolescents who receive good antenatal (before birth) care are no different from those of older women. However, antenatal care may not be available, and even if it is available, adolescents are more likely to seek care later in their pregnancies or to not seek antenatal care at all.: They may not recognize the signs of pregnancy, may want to hide a pregnancy, may not realize care is available or may not be able to afford the fees charged. There are several medical and social reasons to delay child bearing.
</p>
<img class="img" src="images/pregnancy.png" >
<h5>Figure 35</h5>
<h5>Medical reasons to delay childbirth include:</h5>
<ul>● A young woman under age 16 has not reached physical maturity. A small pelvis can lead to a difficult delivery, as well as lead to health problems or death of the mother or the infant.<br>
● Young women, especially those under age 15, are more likely than women age 20 and older to experience premature labor, spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and stillbirths.<br>
● First births are typically more risky than subsequent births. Women giving birth for the first time have a higher probability of developing health problems.<br>
● Infant death rates are typically higher for adolescent mothers than for older women
</ul>
<h4>Some social reasons to delay childbearing include:</h4><hr>
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<ul>● Delaying childbearing can give young women the opportunity to pursue formal education, work outside the home, and achieve their future goals.<br>
● Men can pursue education and jobs without the pressure of providing for a family.<br>
● Delayed pregnancy can mean smaller families and can offer economic benefits.<br>
● Pregnant girls may be expelled from or drop out of school and few girls return to school later.<br>
● The responsibility for caring for a child, as well as limited education, reduces a young woman’s access to jobs and income-earning opportunities.<br>
● Some young women find themselves rejected by the father of the child or by their own families
</ul>
<h4>Fertilization:</h4>
<p>Takes place when a male sperm cell meets a female egg. Millions of sperm cells are deposited into the vagina during sexual intercourse. After the male ejaculates in the vagina, ejaculated sperm swim up through the cervix into the uterus. The woman’s body helps guide the sperm through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes. If a mature egg (or more than one egg in the case of twins) is present, fertilization can take place. Although thousands of sperm may be present, only one sperm cell can penetrate the egg. Sperm can fertilize an egg up to seven days after intercourse. If an egg is fertilized, it will move from the fallopian tube into the uterus (womb) where it will grow.</p>
<h4>Implantation</h4>
<p>Takes place when a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the woman’s uterus. The nutrients in the lining of the uterus are used to support the growth of the egg into a fetus and then a baby. The woman will not experience periods during pregnancy because the lining of the uterus, which normally sheds during menstruation, is not shed at all during pregnancy. The implanted egg grows in the uterus for nine months and becomes a baby. It then comes out of the mother’s body through the process of childbirth.</p>
<h5>Consequences of early pregnancy</h5>
<ul>● School drop out<hr>
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
● Discrimination from peers<br>
● Medicals risks during delivery<br>
● Emotional challenges when one is not ready<br>
● Disappointing parents ● Not achieving dreams<br>
● Being forced to marry old men
</ul>
<h1 id="A5">Session 5: Peer Pressure</h1>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<ul>1.  Define the term peer pressure<br>
2.  Analyze the influence of family, peers, culture, media, technology, and other factors on health behaviors.<br>
3.  To increase connectedness and create a sense of belonging with supportive peer network.
</ul>
<img class="img" src="images/pressure.png" >
<h5>Figure 36</h5><hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h5>Activity</h5>
<p>Let us start by answering essential questions:</p>
<ul>● What does Peer Pressure mean?<br>
● What are the two types of peer pressure?</ul>
<p>Peer pressure is the influence exerted by a peer group, encouraging individuals to change their attitudes, values, or behaviors in order to conform to group norms.<br>
It can either be good or bad peer pressure.
</p>
<img class="img" src="images/pressure2.png" >
<h5>Figure 37</h5>
<h5>Types of peer pressure</h5>
<ul>Bad peer pressure - is being coerced into doing something that you didn't want to because your friends said that you should.<br>Good peer pressure - is being pushed into something that you didn't have the courage to do or just didn't cross your mind to do.<br>Can also be a situation when your friend(s) convinces you not to do something you were going to do because it wasn't in your best interest?</ul><hr>
<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h3>REASONS FOR GIVING TO PEER PRESSURE</h3>
<ul>● Identity.<br>
● To conform.<br>
● Fear of ridicule.<br>
● Curiosity for fads and fashion.<br>
● Mob psychology-I.e. everyone’s doing it.
</ul>
<h4>IDENTIFYING PEER PRESSURE.</h4>
<p>It is important to realize none of these indicators are signs an youth has succumbed to peer pressure; there is no definitive way to predict this.<br>
However the following are usually reliable signs that an adolescent has begun to conform to peer pressure.<br>
They include changes in:
</p>
<ul>● Behavior.<br>
● Language.<br>
● Clothing. <br>● Attitudes.
● Preferences (music, etc.)<br>
● Values, morals, or beliefs.
</ul>
<p>An overall change producing a new or completely different person than what is normal for that adolescent.</p>
<h3>MECHANISMS OF HANDLING PEER PRESSURE INCLUDE.</h3>
<h5>CHOOSE AND CLASSIFY YOUR FRIENDS WISELY:</h5>
<ul>1.  Not you’re Friend.<br>
2.  Acquaintance.<br>
3.  Wannabe Friends.
</ul>
<h5>True Friends</h5>
<p>Choose your friends, don’t let them choose you.</p>
<ul>● Knowing who to listen to and who to avoid is the biggest step in fighting unwanted, negative peer pressure.<br><br>● Be informed by reading in the library, researching in the library, listening to audio tapes, asking close friends about the possible drawbacks of each of the activities you are being asked to try out.<br>● Express you’re NO repeatedly AND WALK AWAY. It takes tremendous will power but it is worthy your respect.<br>● Take time to think: Take as long as you need just to think about whether you want to do it, think about whether you should, and finally think about the consequences.<br>● Seek help from adults you respect, trust and revere for guidance e.g. parent, teacher, or school counselor.<br>● Have a role model or hero. Ask yourself if he was in the same scenario what would he do?<br>● Know who is asking you to do something as per above classification. If the person is not your friend, you should really consider what they want you to do, but if you know, trust and respect this person then you might seriously consider what they ask.(as a last resort, some of our best friends have turned out to mislead us.)
